## osuStandardScoreCalc

# What this does:
This takes a song you selected from your osu! songs directory and calculates the score you would obtain if the song was scored using the osu! standard formula.

# What will it do in the future:
* Estimate Performance Points for all game modes using standard formulas
	* Estimate Performance Points based off of average notes hit
	* Estimate Performance Points based off of map modifiers
* Estimate the difficulty for all non standard game modes
	* Mania - Speed and Keys 
	* Taiko - Stamina
	* CTB - ??? (I'm not too familiar with catch the beat)
